This Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) analysis was perfromed to analyse the factors that are associated with the suicidal or self-harm behaviors of jail inmates. 

The Zero-inflated model is a mix of a logistic regression and a poisson model with a joint maximum likelihood. It is more appropriate in this scenario than the traditional logistic regression or Poisson due to the fact that the inmates included in this study can be either actively serving or released. For those who are actively serving, the fact that they have not committed any self-harm attempts does not guarantee that they will never make such attempts in the future, which "inflates" the data with excess zeros.
